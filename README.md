# Recrutation task - Text Mapper

Simple program in Java that indexes each letter in the selected text and maps it to the words in which it occurs. The program is not case-sensitive. Words that repeat in the input text appear only once in the indexed output. The assigned words for each letter are sorted alphabetically.
